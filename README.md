# GO GO Travel

This is the group project of a course named The Art of Web Programming at UIUC. This app aims to provide a platform which can record user travel stories for wherever they go, and it can also help with travel destination recommendation based on user profile and flight price.

## Getting started

First, `npm install`. Then make sure you have two terminals open; in one, type `npm start` to run the backend, and in the other, type `npm run dev` to run the frontend. 

Make sure you put your own database URI into `config/index.json`.
